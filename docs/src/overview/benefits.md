# Benefits of USDI

## USDi holders earn compounding yield without staking.

Most stablecoins only earn yield when they are staked. On the other hand, LP tokens do not have enough liquidity to be used as a medium of exchange. This is like having to pay for everything in cash, while every ATM withdrawal costs 10 to 100 dollars in gas fee.

In contrast, USDi is both a stablecoin and an LP token. Because it is an LP token, all circulating USDi continuously and automatically accrues interest. Because USDi is a stablecoin, you can use it directly to purchase other assets without redeeming it for USDC.

You can simply hold USDi in your wallet and watch your balance grow. An investor providing ETH-USDi liquidity to an automated market maker earns interest on the USDi portion of their liquidity.


## USDI is stable

The safest way to peg a stablecoin is to back it by assets. USDi is always over-collateralized by a combination of USDC reserves and collateral posted by borrowers. 

## USDI is scalable

Anyone can mint USDi by either depositing USDC or posting collateral and borrowing USDi. At a given interest rate, users can borrow more USDi than other major stablecoins.

## Borrowing USDI is capital efficient
Compared to existing lenders, at any given interest rate, Interest Protocol is able to make generate more loans without incurring additional liquidity risk. This efficiency gain is shared by all users of the protocol. Borrowers can borrow more at lower rates, and each additional loan creates more USDi holders who earn yield.
