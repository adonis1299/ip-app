# Governance Overview

## The Role of IPT Holders & Protocol Governance

Interest Protocol Token (IPT) is the governance token for Interest Protocol. Token holders can influence the protocol and lead it after launch by creating and voting on proposals. Governance should be thought as the mechism to institue change in the protocol and token holders as the management of the protocol.

Token holders (management) have three main responsibilities:
1. To prevent the centralization of power, manage control of the protocol, and asymmetry of information. An important part of building and maintaing a strong foundation is the community. The community needs to share the control of the protocol so no one alone can control the protocol, but control is still possible.
2. To maintain the existing protocol. Typically, that means adjusting LTVs, interest rate curves, liquidation incentives, the protocol fee and other parameters. Management will need to have a strong understanding of the platform and its competitors to make informed decisions.
3. To innovate and adapt. Management should think about the future of the platform. DeFi has a rapidly evolving landscape, and good management will guide the protocol to adapt to the evolving landscape to remain competitive and further grow the platform's market share.

## Capabilities

Holders of IPT have the ability to make substantial upgrades to Interest Protocol. These include, but are not limited to:

- Adding collateral assets
- Altering interest rate curves
- Altering collateral asset's specifications
- Funding grants to support the development of the protocol
- Revising liquidation incentives

## Governance Communications & Discussions
Collaboration and discussion is key to good governance. To paritipcate in protocol innovation we have the Interest Protocol Forum and Discord. The Discord is helpful quick questions and fluid conversation and the forum is more condusive to longterm and or more thoughful discussions. Holders of IPT are encouraged to visit it regularly for updates and participate in discussions.

## Proposal Process
The process for upgrading or altering the Interest Protocol typically consists of two steps, first a Consensus Check and then a Proposal Vote.

A *Consensus Check* confirms whether the community should invest time producing and coding a proposal, and potentially whether Interest Protocol should grant funding for an audit of that proposal code.

When formulating a Consensus Check, authors should strive to:

- Be clear and avoid ambiguity about the effects of their proposal.
- Avoid contradiction with existing code unless the intent is to remove/edit active code.
- Be as brief as possible.
- Be complete. Any reliance upon previous or future proposals should be explicit and clear.

Consensus Checks must have a 5-day voting window.

In order to initiate a Consensus Check, a proposer must have (or have been delegated) .01% of IPT supply.

In order for a Consensus Check to be successful, it must have more Yes votes than No, and meet a quorum of .5% of IPT supply participating in the vote.

Consensus Check votes occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/).

A *Proposal Vote* approves and executes a formalized proposal, which has already passed a Consensus Check and has completed and audited code.

In order to initiate a Proposal Vote, a proposer must have (or have been delegated) 1% of IPT supply.

Proposal Votes have a 5-day voting window. Proposal Votes have a 48-hour time lock during which they are queued before execution.

In order for a Proposal Vote to be successful, it must have more Yes votes than No, and meet a quorum of 5% of IPT supply participating in the vote.

The sponsor of a Proposal Vote does not need to be the same as the sponsor of the Consensus Check. This allows those who successfully proposed a Consensus Check to collaborate with a party that meets the threshold to initiate a Proposal Vote.

Proposal Votes occur on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz).

Token holders are strongly encouraged to communicate early about proposal ideas, and to solicit feedback in the forum.

## Emergency Proposals
There may be a need for urgent action, for which an Emergency Proposal can be used.

An *Emergency Proposal* is a special proposal with its own voting period, quourm threshold, and timelock period. Currently the voting period is 12-hours. Emergency Proposals have a 6-hour time lock during which they are queued before execution.

In order to initiate an Emergency Proposal, a proposer must have (or have been delegated) 1% of IPT supply.

In order for an Emergency Proposal to be successful, it must have more Yes votes than No, and meet a quorum of 51% of IPT supply.

Emergency Proposals occur on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz).
