Token holders can influence the protocol and play a role in leading the protocol after launch by creating and voting on proposals.

## ![image](../../../res/images/USDI.svg) USDi

USDi is a scalable stablecoin that is pegged to $1. Users can exchange USDi with USDC at a 1:1 exchange rate because USDi is over-collateralized by a combination of USDC and borrowersâ€™ collateral. Furthermore, USDi scales flexibly in response to demand because anyone can mint USDi by depositing USDC or borrow USDi against collateral.
