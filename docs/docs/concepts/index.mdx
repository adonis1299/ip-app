# Concepts 

## Borrowing

Users can borrow USDi from Interest Protocol by posting ERC20 assets as collateral in their vault.

## Governance

Interest Protocol is owned and managed by holders of its governance token, called Interest Protocol Token (IPT). Governance is the processes and mechanisms used by IPT holders to institute changes to the protocol. IPT holders can create and vote on proposals to update Interest Protocol.

## Risks

Interest Protocol manages two types of market risks - liquidity risk and credit risk.

## USDi

USDi is a stablecoin pegged to $1. Users can exchange USDi with USDC at a 1:1 exchange rate. USDi is over-collateralized by a combination of USDC and borrowersâ€™ collateral. USDi scales flexibly in response to demand because anyone can mint USDi by depositing USDC or borrowing USDi against thier collateral.
