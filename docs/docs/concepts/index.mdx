# Concepts 

## Governance


Interest Protocol's governance token is the Interest Protocol Token (IPT). IPT holders can create and vote on proposals to influence the development of the protocol after launch. While governance can be thoughts of as the mechanisms available to manage the protocol changes IPT holders manage the protocol using those mechanisms.

## USDi

USDi is a scalable stablecoin that is pegged to $1. Users can exchange USDi with USDC at a 1:1 exchange rate because USDi is over-collateralized by a combination of USDC and borrowersâ€™ collateral. Furthermore, USDi scales flexibly in response to demand because anyone can mint USDi by depositing USDC or borrowing USDi against thier collateral.
