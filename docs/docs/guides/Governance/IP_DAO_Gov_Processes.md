# IP Dao Governance Processes

## Governance Responsibilities & Capabilities
Holders of IPT have the ability to make substantial upgrades to Interest Protocol. These include, but are not limited to:

* Altering interest rate curves
* Altering required levels of collateralization
* Registering and de-registering new forms of collateral
* Funding grants to support the development of the protocol
* Revising liquidation incentives

## Governance Communications & Discussions
Interest Protocol governance centers its communications around the Interest Protocol DAO forum. Discussions around the governance of Interest Protocol, as well as any official communications or reports will be published on the forum. Holders of IPT are encouraged to visit it regularly for updates and participate in discussions.

## Proposal Process
The process for upgrading or altering the Interest Protocol typically consists of two steps, first a Consensus Check and then a Proposal Vote.


### Consensus Check
A *Consensus Check* confirms whether the community should invest time producing and coding a proposal, and potentially whether Interest Protocol should grant funding for an audit of that proposal code.

When formulating a Consensus Check, authors should strive to:

* Be clear and avoid ambiguity about the effects of their proposal.
* Avoid contradiction with existing code unless the intent is to remove/edit active code.
* Be as brief as possible.
* Be complete. Any reliance upon previous or future proposals should be explicit and clear.

Consensus Checks must have a 5-day voting window.

In order to initiate a Consensus Check, a proposer must have (or have been delegated) 0.01% of IPT supply.

In order for a Consensus Check to be successful, it must have more Yes votes than No, and meet a quorum of 2.5% of IPT supply participating in the vote.

Consensus Check votes occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/).

### Proposal

A *Proposal Vote* approves and executes a formalized proposal, which has already passed a Consensus Check and has completed and audited code.

Proposal Votes have a 5-day voting window. Proposal Votes have a 48-hour time lock during which they are queued before execution.

In order to initiate a Proposal Vote, a proposer must have (or have been delegated) 0.10% of IPT supply.

In order for a Proposal Vote to be successful, it must have more Yes votes than No, and meet a quorum of 10% of IPT supply participating in the vote.

The sponsor of a Proposal Vote does not need to be the same as the sponsor of the Consensus Check. This allows those who successfully proposed a Consensus Check to collaborate with a party that meets the threshold to initiate a Proposal Vote.

Proposal Votes occur on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz).

Governance token holders are strongly encouraged to communicate early about proposal ideas, and to solicit feedback in the forum. 

### Emergency Proposals
There may be a need for urgent action, for which an Emergency Proposal can be used.

An *Emergency Proposal* is a special proposal that skips the review period, has a 1-day voting window, and 12-hour timelock period.

In order to initiate an Emergency Proposal, a proposer must have (or have been delegated) 0.10% of IPT supply.

In order for an Emergency Proposal to be successful, it must have more Yes votes than No, and meet a quorum of 50% of IPT supply.

Emergency Proposals occur on [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz).
