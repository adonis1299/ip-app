# Lending

Becoming a lender at Interest Protocol is easy.

1. Make sure you have a balance of USDC.
2. Go to Interest Protocol's interface and connect your wallet.
3. Enter the number of USDC you want to deposit and click deposit

Once the transaction is mined, USDC will transfer from your wallet to the protocol's reserve, and you will receive USDi.

Interest is paid to USDi holders by updating all USDi holders' balances.

USDi holders can redeem their USDi for USDC anytime by visiting the same interface.
