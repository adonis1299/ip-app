# Lending

All USDi holders are depositors, or lenders, of Interest Protocol. Holding USDi is like having money in your bank account - the protocol pays you interest, and you can directly use USDi to purchase other assets.

To become a lender:

1. Have a balance of USDC in your wallet.
2. Go to Interest Protocol's interface and connect your wallet.
3. Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit and click deposit.

The deposit transaction will transfer the USDC from your wallet to the protocol reserve, and USDi will be minted in your wallet.

To redeem USDi for USDC, take the following steps:

1. Have a balance of USDi in your wallet.
2. Go to Interest Protocol's interface and connect your wallet.
3. Enter the amount of USDC you want to withdraw and click withdraw.

The withdraw transaction will burn the USDi in your wallet and transfer USDC from the protocol reserve to your wallet.
