# Contracts Overview

## Core Contracts
* `USDi`: USDi rebases positively using `Ufragments` developed by Ampleforth. The contract is upgradable via governance.
* `Vault`: each borrower posts collateral assets in their own vault. The contract is not upgradable.
* `VaultController`: contains the core math and the functionalities of the protocol. Each `Vault` references `VaultController`. The contract is upgradable via governance

## Periphery Contracts
* `CurveMaster`: `VaultController` calls this contract to calculate the borrow rate. Address is set at `VaultController`.
    * ThreeLines0_100: called by `CurveMaster` to calculate the borrow rate.
* `OracleMaster`: called by `VaultController` to get prices. Address is set at `VaultController`.
    * `AnchoredViewRelay`: called by `OracleMaster` to sanity-check the main oracle against the anchor oracle.
    * `ChainlinkOracleRelay`: called by `AnchoredViewRelay`. Gets `lastestAnswer` from the Chainlink oracle. Serves as the main oracle.
    * `UniswapV3OracleRelay`: called by `AnchoredViewRelay`. Calculates the TWAP from a UniV3 pair. Serves as the anchor oracle.

## Governance Contracts
* `GovernorDelegate`: implementation governance contract. 
* `GovernorDelegator`: base governance contract that references the implementation for core logic.

## Token Contracts
* `TokenDelegate`: implementation token contract.
* `TokenDelegator`: base token contract that references the implementation for core logic.
