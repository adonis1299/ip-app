# Liquidity Mining

Interest Protocol runs two liquidity mining programs to bootstrap protocol usage. First, the protocol provides IPT rewards to those who borrow USDi from the protocol. Second, the protocol provides IPT rewards to market makers who provide ETH-USDi liquidity on Uniswap V2. 10% of IPT supply is earmarked for liquidity mining rewards.


## Borrowing Incentives

Interest Protocol will distribute IPT rewards to users who borrow USDi from Interest Protocol. The initial distribution speed will be 2.015333446 IPT per block. If the protocol were to decrease the distribution speed by 0.1832121315 IPT per block every three months, the protocol would end up distributing around 6.67 percent of the IPT supply through borrowing incentives over the course of two years.

Note that rewarding borrowers also benefits depositors (USDi holders) as well through higher interest rates. Depositors will reap this benefit without having to spend gas to claim rewards.


## Market Making Incentives

Interest Protocol will distribute IPT rewards to users who provide ETH-USDi liquidity on Uniswap v2. The initial distribution speed will be 1.007666723 IPT per block. If the protocol were to decrease the distribution speed by 0.09160606573 IPT per block every three months, the protocol would end up distributing around 3.33 percent of the IPT supply through market making incentives over the course of two years.
